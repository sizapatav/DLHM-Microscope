# DLHM-Microscope

DLHM-Microscope is a cost-effective digital lensless holographic microscope developed by Grupo de Optica y Procesamiento OptoDigital (OD) of National University of Colombia. This platform enables the record of digital holograms, it has all the degrees of freedom needed to achieve different fields of view, levels of spatial resolution, and 2D scanning of the sample. This microscope is constructed using 3D printing, fastening elements, a digital camera, and aspheric lens. 

OD research group also developed an open-source plugin for image processing of recorded holograms in ImageJ.
