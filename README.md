# DLHM-Microscope

DLHM-Microscope is a cost-effective digital lensless holographic microscope developed by Opto-Digital Processing Group of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. This platform enables the recording of digital holograms with all the needed degrees of freedom to achieve different fields of view, levels of spatial resolution, and 2D scanning of the sample. This microscope is constructed using 3D printing, fastening elements, a digital camera, and an aspheric lens.

Opto-Digital Processing Group also developed an open-source plugin for image processing of recorded holograms in ImageJ.
